# Loan Performance Analysis

## Introduction
This project is a full exploratory data analysis (EDA) of loan issuance data. It focuses on understanding how loans are distributed, who takes them, and the operational performance behind the scenes.

### Tools Used: 
- SQL Server for querying, 
- Power BI for visualization, 
- Excel for data review.

The goal is to answer key business questions like:
- How many loans are issued each month?
- Which team and loan agents issue the most loans?
- How are loans distributed by value ranges?
- How many clients take a second loan and how long do they wait?
- Which weekdays and loan types are most popular?
- How many applications come from each source and which source brings the most value?
- What is the average loan issuance time by agent and team?
- How many loans are active daily?
