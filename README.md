# Loan Performance Analysis

## Introduction
This project is a full exploratory data analysis (EDA) of loan issuance data. It focuses on understanding how loans are distributed, who takes them, and the operational performance behind the scenes.

### Tools Used: 
- SQL Server for querying, 
- Power BI for visualization, 
- Excel for data review.

The goal is to answer key business questions like:
- How many loans are issued each month?
- Which team and loan agents issue the most loans?
- How are loans distributed by value ranges?
- How many clients take a second loan and how long do they wait?
- Which weekdays and loan types are most popular?
- How many applications come from each source and which source brings the most value?
- What is the average loan issuance time by agent and team?
- How many loans are active daily?

## Dataset Description
Source: Provided Excel file Task 2025 v2 - Data Analyst.xlsx
### Key Tables/Fields:
- Client_id: Unique identifier for each client
- Loan_agent, team: Responsible personnel and group
- Application_date, issuance_date: Timeline of loan processing
- Status: Loan status (5 = issued, 6 = cancelled)
- Loan_type, loan_amount: Product and value details
- Source: Origin of application (e.g., web, referral)
- First_status_change_date: Initial status update timestamp

## Database Exploration
Before diving into analysis, a thorough exploration of the dataset was conducted to understand its structure, assess data quality, and identify key fields relevant to the business questions.

## Key Business Questions
These are the critical questions guiding the loan analysis, designed to uncover actionable insights and support data-driven decision-making:

#### Loan KPI's
```sql
SELECT 
	'Total Issued Loan Value'Description, SUM(Loan_value) Value
FROM Loans
WHERE application_status = 5
UNION
SELECT 
	'Total Cancelled Loan Value' ,SUM(Loan_value) 
FROM Loans
WHERE application_status = 6
UNION
SELECT 
	'Number of Issued Loans' ,COUNT(*) 
FROM Loans
WHERE application_status = 5
UNION
SELECT 
	'Number of Cancelled Loans' ,COUNT(*) 
FROM Loans
WHERE application_status = 6
UNION
SELECT 
	'Number of Customers' ,COUNT(DISTINCT Client_id) 
FROM Loans

#### How many loans are issued each month?

```sql
SELECT 
	FORMAT(application_creation_date, 'yyyy-MM') Month,
	COUNT(*) LoansIssued
FROM Loans
WHERE application_status = 5
GROUP BY FORMAT(application_creation_date, 'yyyy-MM')
```

##### Insight:

 This is the core volume metric that drives revenue. Itâ€™s the starting point for understanding growth trends.

#### Which team and loan agents issue the most loans?
##### By Team:

```sql

SELECT 
	T.team,
	COUNT(DISTINCT L.application_id) LoansIssued
FROM Loans L
INNER JOIN [Loan Status] LS ON L.application_id = LS.application_id
INNER JOIN Team T ON L.loan_agent_id = T.agent_id
WHERE application_status = 5
GROUP BY T.team
ORDER BY LoansIssued DESC
```

##### By Agent:
```sql
SELECT TOP 1
	l.loan_agent,
	COUNT(*) LoansIssued
FROM Loans L
WHERE application_status = 5 
AND loan_agent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY L.loan_agent
ORDER BY LoansIssued DESC
```

#### How are loans distributed by value ranges?

```sql
SELECT 
    CONCAT(FLOOR(loan_value / 1000) * 1000, '-', FLOOR(loan_value / 1000) * 1000 + 999) AS LoanRange,
    COUNT(*) AS TotalLoans,
    SUM(loan_value) AS TotalValue
FROM Loans
WHERE application_status = 5
GROUP BY FLOOR(loan_value / 1000)
ORDER BY FLOOR(loan_value / 1000);
```

#### How many clients take a second loan and how long do they wait?
```sql
SELECT 
	client_id ,
	COUNT(*) LoanCount
FROM Loans
WHERE application_status = 5
GROUP BY client_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

<img width="145" height="260" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-11 221257" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98b0bde6-e380-4960-af27-722a477780ae" />

#### How Long do they wait to take another loan
```sql
SELECT 
  client_id,
  COUNT(*) AS loan_count,
  MIN(application_creation_date) AS first_loan_date,
  MAX(application_creation_date) AS last_loan_date,
  DATEDIFF(DAY, MIN(application_creation_date), MAX(application_creation_date)) AS DaysBetweenLoans
FROM Loans
WHERE application_status = 5
GROUP BY client_id
HAVING  COUNT(*) >1
ORDER BY DaysBetweenLoans DESC;
```
